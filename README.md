# local-distinguishability
Implementation of the optimization problems discussed in my PhD thesis (see [draft](https://github.com/cosenal/phd-thesis)).

## Requirements
- MATLAB (tested only with R2015a, most probably working with lower versions)
- [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) >= 2.1 
- [QETLAB](https://github.com/nathanieljohnston/QETLAB) >= 0.7

## FAQ
### MATLAB?! :(
Unfortunately at the time of writing this, the package CVX only runs on Matlab. 
I promise that I will port all the code to GNU Octave once the Octave port of CVX will be completed.
For updates on that, follow [CVXR on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cvxr).
